# Welcome to Supervised Learning!

Within this subdirectory, we explore many flavors of Supervised Learning. I recommend going in the labeled order (i.e. 1.1, 1.2, etc.) in order for the notebooks to build on the ideas introduced previously.

In general, Supervised learning is a type of machine learning in which the algorithm is trained on a labeled dataset in order to learn how to make accurate predictions or classifications on new, unseen data. There are two main types of supervised learning models: parameterized and nonparameterized.

Parameterized models, also known as parametric models, have a fixed number of parameters that are determined during the training process. These models make assumptions about the underlying distribution of the data and try to find the best-fit values for the parameters. Examples of parameterized models include linear regression, logistic regression, and neural networks.

Nonparameterized models, also known as nonparametric models, do not make any assumptions about the underlying distribution of the data and instead attempt to learn directly from the data without any preconceived notions. Examples of nonparameterized models include decision trees, random forests, and KNN.

Supervised learning tasks can also be broadly classified into two categories: classification and regression.

Classification models are used to predict the class or category that a given input belongs to. The input data is labeled with discrete class labels, and the goal of the model is to correctly assign new, unseen data to one of these predefined classes. Examples of classification models include logistic regression, decision trees, and KNN.

Regression models, on the other hand, are used to predict a continuous numerical value, such as the price of a house or the temperature at a given time. The input data is labeled with a continuous target variable, and the goal of the model is to accurately predict the value of this variable for new, unseen data. Examples of regression models include linear regression, polynomial regression, and neural networks.

In summary, supervised learning involves training a machine learning model on labeled data to make accurate predictions or classifications on new, unseen data. Models can be parameterized or nonparameterized, and tasks can be classified into either classification or regression.
