## Dense Neural Networks

Dense Neural Networks, also known as Multilayer Perceptrons, are a type of machine learning model that is widely used for both classification and regression tasks. They are called "dense" because they are made up of multiple layers of neurons, where each neuron takes in the outputs of all the neurons in the previous layer and passes its own output to all the neurons in the next layer. This creates a dense network of connections between the neurons in different layers.

Dense Neural Networks are a parametric model, which means that they have a fixed set of parameters (weights and biases) that need to be learned from the data. The model is trained using a variant of the Gradient Descent algorithm, called Backpropagation, which measures the difference between the predicted output and the true output for each example in the training data. The goal of the training process is to minimize this difference.

Dense Neural Networks can be used for both classification and regression tasks, depending on the type of output layer used. The notebook will make comments about different activation functions.

One of the advantages of Dense Neural Networks is their ability to learn complex, nonlinear relationships between the input variables and the output variable. They can also handle large amounts of data and are able to generalize well to new data. Dense Neural Networks are widely used in applications such as image classification, speech recognition, natural language processing, and predictive analytics.

In summary, Dense Neural Networks are a parametric model made up of multiple layers of neurons that can be used for both classification and regression tasks. They are trained using the Backpropagation algorithm, and can learn complex, nonlinear relationships between the input and output variables. They are widely used in a variety of applications and are known for their ability to handle large amounts of data and generalize well to new data.

Within the notebook you may find an explanation of how the model works as well as an application to the cbb dataset.
