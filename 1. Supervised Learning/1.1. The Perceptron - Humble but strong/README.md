## The Perceptron

The Perceptron is a humble but strong single neuron model in the field of machine learning. It is a type of parameterized model that is used for binary classification tasks, which involve separating data into two classes based on their features. The model is based on a simple algorithm that learns from training data by iteratively updating its weights until it is able to correctly classify the data. The idea of a single neuron model is inspired by actual neurons and is the building block for more complex parameterized models.

Within the notebook you may find an explanation of how the model works as well as an implementation and application to the cbb dataset.
