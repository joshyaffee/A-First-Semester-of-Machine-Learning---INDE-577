# A First Semester of Machine Learning - INDE 577
### Joshua Yaffee, Spring 2023

In this repo, we take a tour of the Machine Learning models and techniques covered in Rice University's INDE 577 (Spring 2023) taught by Dr. Randy Davila. Each subdirectory will containt a README file with a very brief overview of the contents. Each subdirectory will also include a Jupyter Notebook where the topic is thoroughly explained in markdown and applied using Python. 

We learn about each topic by investigating a dataset about college basketball teams in recent years, cbb.csv. The dataset contains statistics from the teams season as well as seeding and performance in the NCAA Tournament.

The bulk of the tour is Supervised Learning where we cover topics ranging from the Perceptron to Random Forests. Finally, we apply what we know to a healthcare dataset with the goal of predicting strokes. This was a project in colaboration with George Lyu (Rice University, 2024). Next, we look at Unsupervised Learning, specifically Clustering and PCA. Within the clustering notebook, there is a bonus algorithm and its implementation. Finally, our tour ends with brief summaries of Reinforcement Learning and Pretrained Models, two topics briefly covered in INDE 577. Below you can find the table of contents.

I omit a requirements.txt file, as the libraries and versions I used are few in numbers and quite standard and robust.

Enjoy the tour!
