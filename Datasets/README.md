Here are the two datasets used in this project. 

- cbb.csv details college basketball teams' statistics as well as their postseason seeding and performance. This dataset makes for interesting applications of the models and techniques presented in INDE 577.
- healthcare-dataset-stroke-data.csv details patients' statistics (e.g. BMI, marital status, etc.) as well as if they have had a stroke. This dataset allows us to test the strength of more robust models on imbalanced data.

Both datasets are publicly available.
