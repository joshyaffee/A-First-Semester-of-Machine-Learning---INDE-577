# One Semester is not Enough!

Machine learning is not limited to supervised and unsupervised learning, as there are other categories of models such as reinforcement learning, evolutionary algorithms, and semi-supervised learning, among others. Reinforcement learning is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to take actions in an environment to maximize a reward. Pretrained models are machine learning models that have been trained on a large dataset and can be used as a starting point for other machine learning tasks, often with significant improvements in efficiency and accuracy.

In this notebook, I briefly summarize reinforcement learning and pretrained models which were briefly covered in class. This will be the end of our tour, but the start of my learning of Machine Learning and broadly, Artificial Intelligence.
