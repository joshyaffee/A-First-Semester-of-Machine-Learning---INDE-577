# Welcome to Unsupervised Learning

Again, it is recomended to view my work in labeled order.

Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning that involves training a model on unlabeled data, without any explicit input-output pairs. The goal of unsupervised learning is to find patterns and relationships in the data that can be used to discover insights, make predictions, or perform other tasks.

Unsupervised learning is typically used when there is no clear target variable or output label, or when the data is too complex to be labeled manually. Examples of applications of unsupervised learning include anomaly detection, market segmentation, image and text analysis, and recommendation systems.

Two common types of unsupervised learning are clustering and dimensionality reduction.

Clustering is a technique that involves grouping similar data points together into clusters, based on their similarity or distance from each other. The goal of clustering is to identify natural groups or patterns in the data, which can then be used to gain insights or make predictions.

Dimensionality reduction is a technique that involves reducing the number of features or variables in the data, while retaining as much information as possible. This is often done to make the data more manageable, to remove noise or redundancy, or to discover latent features or relationships.

Overall, unsupervised learning is a powerful tool for discovering patterns and relationships in unlabeled data, and can be used in a wide range of applications in data science and machine learning.
